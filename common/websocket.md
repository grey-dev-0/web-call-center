[Laravel Websockets](https://beyondco.de/docs/laravel-websockets/getting-started/introduction) is a library used internally by this project that enables the server to monitor which customer support agents are currently online within each organization, so that incoming calls can only be assigned to online agents.

To set it up please refer to [Laravel Websockets installation page](../third-parties/websocket/#laravel-websockets-integration).
