## 3. Integrating Agora

The package relies on [Agora IO](https://agora.io) WebRTC services to implement the voice calls feature between customers and agents, the service provides a free plan that's a good starter for this project so, first you'll have to sign up to their service [here](https://sso.agora.io/en/signup) or, if you already have an account you can directly use it.

For detailed steps on how to setup Agora in our project please refer to [Agora installation page](/third-pariesy/agora/).
